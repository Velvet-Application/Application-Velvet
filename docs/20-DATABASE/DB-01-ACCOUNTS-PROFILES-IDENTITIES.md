# Velvet Database Bible — DB-01

## Accounts, identities, profiles and shared profile governance

**Status:** Proposed for validation  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Scope:** Platform Core  
**Applies to:** Community, Professionals, Administration  
**Related decisions:** ADR-DATA-046, V1 Dual Platform Scope, Target Architecture V1

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical data model for:

- authenticated Velvet accounts;
- personal identities;
- age and identity verification state;
- independent and shared profiles;
- profile memberships and roles;
- couple profile governance;
- sensitive-action approvals;
- account and profile lifecycle;
- consent, traceability and deletion boundaries.

This document is normative. Application code, APIs, database migrations and tests must conform to it.

---

## 2. Locked product principles

1. One human being owns one personal Velvet account.
2. Login credentials are never shared between partners.
3. An account may participate in several profiles.
4. A couple profile is a shared profile, not a shared account.
5. A shared profile is linked to at least two verified personal accounts.
6. Daily profile management may be delegated according to role permissions.
7. Sensitive actions require explicit approval from all required profile members.
8. Personal data, profile data and verification data remain separated.
9. Every sensitive mutation must be auditable.
10. No profile may be publicly discoverable until mandatory onboarding and trust requirements are satisfied.

## 3. Domain model

```text
Auth User
   │
   └── Account
        ├── Personal Identity
        ├── Verification Cases
        ├── Account Settings
        ├── Devices / Sessions
        └── Profile Memberships
                 │
                 ├── Individual Profile
                 ├── Couple Profile
                 ├── Organizer Profile
                 └── Professional Profile
```

The authentication provider identifies a login subject. The `accounts` table represents the Velvet account. Profiles represent public or operational personas used on the platform.

| `auth_user_id` | `uuid` | no | Unique reference to Supabase Auth user |
| `status` | `account_status` | no | Default `pending_onboarding` |
| `primary_email` | `citext` | no | Unique normalized email |
| `email_verified_at` | `timestamptz` | yes | Provider-confirmed only |
| `phone_e164` | `text` | yes | Unique when present |

## 6. Couple profile rules

### 6.1 Creation workflow

1. Account A creates a draft couple profile.
2. Account A becomes `owner` with active membership.
3. Account A invites Account B using a time-limited invitation.
4. Account B authenticates with their own account.
5. Account B explicitly accepts the invitation.
6. Account B becomes `co_owner`.
7. Both accounts must satisfy required age and identity verification.
8. Both complete their personal profile modules and shared couple modules.
9. A joint activation request is approved.
10. The profile becomes `active`, but remains non-discoverable until visibility is explicitly enabled.

### 6.2 Daily actions

Either owner may, subject to permissions:

- reply to conversations;
- manage favorites;
- update non-sensitive presentation text;
- maintain availability;
- manage ordinary media that does not identify the other partner;
- review notifications and profile activity.

### 6.3 Joint approval actions

The default V1 policy requires approval from both active owners for:

- changing shared identity or couple display framing;
- changing shared searches, practices or limits;
- publishing clearly identifying joint media;
- granting access to a private album containing both members;
- adding or removing a member;
- hiding, archiving or deleting the profile;
- transferring ownership.

### 6.4 Separation or departure

When one partner leaves:

- the departing account keeps its personal account and individual profiles;
- its shared-profile membership becomes `left`;
- private access tokens granted through that membership are revoked;
- pending approvals involving the departing account are cancelled;
- the couple profile immediately becomes `hidden` and non-discoverable;
- the remaining member may archive the profile but may not silently replace the departing partner;
- adding a new partner requires a new invitation and a new shared activation workflow;
- historical messages and audit evidence are retained according to legal and retention rules, but no longer appear as an active couple identity.

---

## 7. Row Level Security model

RLS is mandatory for all user-addressable tables.

### 7.1 Account tables

- a user may select their own `accounts` row;
- a user may select/update their own `account_settings` row;
- direct client access to `account_identities` must be restricted to narrowly scoped read/update RPCs;
- verification cases are readable only by the account owner and privileged trust/admin services;
- clients cannot set verification outcomes or account status directly.

### 7.2 Profiles

Public profile reads use a sanitized discoverable view, not direct unrestricted table access.

A profile member may read private profile data only if:

- membership is `active`;
- account is not suspended or deleted;
- profile is not deleted;
- the requested module permission is granted.

### 7.3 Memberships

- members may read memberships for profiles they belong to;
- invited users may read only the invitation addressed to them;
- membership creation, role changes and removals pass through controlled server-side functions;
- no client may directly promote itself to owner/co-owner.

### 7.4 Sensitive approvals

- eligible profile owners may read pending requests for their profile;
- only eligible approvers may create one decision;
- request execution is backend-only;
- approval payloads are never exposed publicly.

---

## 8. Public profile projection

The application must not expose `profiles` directly as the public contract. Create a sanitized database view or API projection such as `public_profile_view` containing only approved fields:

- profile id;
- display name;
- type;
- public biography;
- coarse location;
- approved public modules;
- trust badges intended for public display;
- public media cover reference;
- public activity signals permitted by privacy settings.

The projection must exclude:

- account ids;
- legal identity;
- exact date of birth;
- email and phone;
- internal moderation state;
- verification provider data;
- private membership details;
- private location coordinates;
- audit and security metadata.

---

## 9. Lifecycle and deletion

### 9.1 Account deletion request

1. Account enters `deletion_requested`.
2. New logins and sensitive actions may be restricted.
3. Active profile memberships are evaluated.
4. Individual profiles are hidden immediately.
5. Shared profiles follow shared-profile departure rules.
6. A retention timer starts according to the legal retention policy.
7. Personal data is deleted or irreversibly anonymized after the retention period unless a legal hold applies.

### 9.2 Profile deletion

- profile deletion is always soft first;
- discoverability is disabled immediately;
- media access grants are revoked;
- public search documents are deleted asynchronously;
- financial, consent, moderation and security evidence may be retained separately where legally required;
- reactivation after final deletion is forbidden; a new profile must be created.

---

## 10. Transaction boundaries

The following operations must be atomic database transactions:

- account activation after successful verification;
- invitation acceptance and role assignment;
- couple profile activation;
- sensitive request approval threshold and mutation execution;
- member departure and immediate profile hiding;
- profile deletion and access revocation;
- ownership transfer;
- account deletion initiation and profile visibility shutdown.

---

## 11. Required domain services

Application pages and UI components must not implement these rules directly.

Required services:

- `AccountService`
- `IdentityVerificationService`
- `ProfileService`
- `ProfileMembershipService`
- `ProfileAuthorizationService`
- `SensitiveActionApprovalService`
- `ProfileLifecycleService`
- `AccountDeletionService`

Each service must expose typed commands and return typed domain errors.

---

## 12. Initial API / server command contracts

```ts
createIndividualProfile(input)
createCoupleProfile(input)
inviteProfileMember(profileId, invitee)
acceptProfileInvitation(invitationToken)
updateProfileBasicInformation(profileId, input)
requestSensitiveProfileAction(profileId, actionType, payload)
approveSensitiveProfileAction(requestId)
rejectSensitiveProfileAction(requestId)
leaveSharedProfile(profileId)
activateProfile(profileId)
setProfileDiscoverability(profileId, enabled)
requestProfileDeletion(profileId)
requestAccountDeletion()
```

All commands require server-side authorization and schema validation.

---

## 13. Acceptance criteria

DB-01 is implemented only when all criteria below pass:

1. A person cannot create two accounts for the same auth subject.
2. Two partners can join one couple profile using separate logins.
3. A couple profile cannot activate with only one verified member.
4. No member can self-promote to owner through a direct database mutation.
5. Sensitive actions cannot execute before the required approvals exist.
6. A changed payload invalidates previous approvals.
7. A partner leaving immediately hides the couple profile.
8. Leaving a couple profile does not delete the person's account.
9. Public APIs never expose legal identity or account contact data.
10. All status transitions create lifecycle and audit evidence.
11. Deleted or suspended accounts cannot approve pending actions.
12. RLS prevents reading another account's private identity data.
13. Profile activation and discoverability are separate operations.
14. All critical operations are covered by integration tests using two distinct authenticated users.

---

## 14. Required tests

### Unit tests

- permission matrix evaluation;
- approval threshold calculation;
- profile activation eligibility;
- account status transition validation;
- profile status transition validation;
- verification-level promotion rules.

### Integration tests

- create and activate individual profile;
- create couple profile and accept partner invitation;
- reject invitation;
- expire invitation;
- approve joint sensitive action;
- reject joint sensitive action;
- partner leaves active couple profile;
- suspended partner attempts approval;
- unauthorized account attempts membership read;
- public profile projection data-leak test;
- account deletion with individual and shared profiles.

### Security tests

- RLS cross-account isolation;
- privilege escalation through role mutation;
- replay of invitation token;
- replay of sensitive-action approval;
- approval after payload replacement;
- direct update of verification result;
- enumeration of private profile memberships.

- constraints are tested;
- RLS tests pass;
- service interfaces exist;
- sensitive-action workflows pass integration tests.

No business rule from this document may be implemented solely in a page, React component or client-side state.

---

## 17. Deferred decisions

These topics are intentionally excluded from DB-01 and will be covered in later database chapters:

- detailed gender, orientation and relationship-model taxonomy;
- practices, searches, limits and consent compatibility;
- media, albums and access grants;
- conversations and messaging identity;
- precise geolocation and proximity search;
- subscriptions and entitlement sharing;
- professional legal entities and staff management;
- reputation, reviews and trust scoring;
- moderation, reporting and sanctions;
- full GDPR retention matrix.

---

## 18. Definition of done

This chapter becomes **Accepted** when:

- product governance validates the rules;
- architecture review validates the model boundaries;
- security review validates RLS and sensitive-action flows;
- the corresponding SQL/Prisma implementation PR passes all automated tests;
- no unresolved blocker remains in the decision registry.
